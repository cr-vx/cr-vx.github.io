      <description>Your browser does not support the video tag.In this project, my biggest task was to implemented FSM-based* enemy AI.
The main objective was to create a challenging and enjoyable experience for the player.
Which required that the AI must be designed to move and shoot intelligently, while also keeping in mind the enemy&amp;rsquo;s low health and the player&amp;rsquo;s long shooting range.
You can learn more about the development in my blog &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s also a post about my time as a scrum master.</description>
